# TF-IDF Implementation Requirements
# This project uses only Python 3 standard library
# No external dependencies required

# All required modules:
# - re (regular expressions)
# - math (mathematical functions)  
# - os (operating system interface)
# - collections (specialized container datatypes)
# - sys (system-specific parameters)
# - importlib (import utilities)

# These are all built into Python 3.6+ - no pip install needed!
